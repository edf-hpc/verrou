"          Verrou always rounds to the nearest floating-point. Supported\n"
"          rounding modes are:\n"
"\n"
"          ·   Random rounding modes: random, average.\n"

"\n"
"      --vr-seed=RNG_SEED [default=automatically generated]\n"
"          If present, this option allows setting the seed of the\n"
"          pseudo-Random Number Generator used for the random or average\n"
"          rounding modes. This helps reproducing the behaviour of a program\n"
"          under Verrou.\n"
"\n"
"          If this option is omitted, the pRNG is seeded with a value based on\n"
